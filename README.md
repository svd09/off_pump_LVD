This figure panel presents the survival (with 95% confidence interval
bands) for OPCAB and ONCAB patients in the entire cohort. red = OPCAB ,
blue = ONCAB.

This figure panel presents the survival (with 95% confidence interval
bands) for OPCAB and ONCAB patients in the matched groups, calculated
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Blue = ONCAB, Red = OPCAB

This figure demonstrates the standardized difference for each co-variate
in the propensity score model. The gray dots represent the entire
cohort, and the black dots represent the 1:1 matched pairs cohort. After
matching, standardized difference for each covariate is between -0.1 and
0.1 demonstrating acceptable model balance. The variable “distance” on
the graphic represents the distance between propensity scores for
patients. BMI body mass index; CAD coronary artery disease; COPD Chronic
