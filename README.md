identifiers.

<u>**Key question:**</u> Is off-pump coronary artery bypass (CABG) safe
and effective in patients with poor left ventricular (LV) function?

<u>**Key findings:**</u> Similar mortality risk between on- and off-pump
CABG (P=0.7); Incomplete revascularization more common in off-pump CABG

<u>**Take-home message:**</u> Off-pump CABG is safe and effective in
patients with LV dysfunction. Target complete revascularization to
improve long-term outcomes.
